## 📖 Overview

**Winery System** is a modular Java-based application designed to manage winery operations efficiently through the use of SOAP Web Services.  
The project is structured into:

- **Publisher**: Backend services exposing core functionalities.
- **Consumers**: Clients interacting with backend services for order placement and stock management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Stock Management Service.
- ✅ Order Placement Service.
- ✅ Warning Notification Service.
- ✅ Modular Java architecture with Maven for dependency management.
- ✅ SOAP-based Web Services using Jakarta EE APIs.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ☕ Java 11+
- 🛠️ Maven 3.6+
- 🌐 Jakarta EE (SOAP, JAX-WS, JAXB)
- 💻 IDE Support: IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code

---

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
Winery
├── Consumer
│   ├── WineOrderClient
│   └── WineStockClient
└── Publisher
    └── WinerySys
```

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or above
- Compatible IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

---

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/winery.git
cd winery/Winery
```

2. **Build all modules using Maven:**

```bash
cd Publisher/WinerySys
mvn clean install
```

```bash
cd ../../Consumer/WineOrderClient
mvn clean install
```

```bash
cd ../WineStockClient
mvn clean install
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### 1. Start the Backend Service

Navigate to the Publisher module and run the `Loader` class:

```bash
cd Publisher/WinerySys
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="br.com.fiap.winery.Loader"
```

This will expose the SOAP services for consumers to interact with.

---

### 2. Run the Consumers

#### ✅ Wine Order Client

```bash
cd Consumer/WineOrderClient
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="br.com.fiap.winery.ApplicationClient2"
```

#### ✅ Wine Stock Client

```bash
cd Consumer/WineStockClient
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="br.com.fiap.winery.ApplicationClient1"
```

---

## 📝 API Documentation

The project uses **SOAP Web Services**. You can inspect the WSDL files generated by the Publisher after running the backend service.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `WineStockService`: Manage wine stock.
  - `WineWarningService`: Notify when stock is low.
  - `PlaceOrder`: Submit orders to the winery.

**Note**: Ensure that the Publisher is running before initiating client operations.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always run `mvn clean install` before running the application to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
- Configure your IDE's SDK to match the required JDK version.
- Mark `src/main/java` as **Sources Root** in your IDE for proper code navigation.
